First, move to [dr-derks-mutant-battlegrounds folder](https://github.com/kimbring2/MOBA_RL/tree/main/dr-derks-mutant-battlegrounds).

Run below command to run the 50 parallel environemnt. I modified [Seel_RL](https://github.com/google-research/seed_rl) of Google for my MOBA case. 

```
$ python learner_1.py --workspace_path [your path]/dr-derks-mutant-battlegrounds/
$ python learner_2.py --workspace_path [your path]/dr-derks-mutant-battlegrounds/
$ python run.py -p1 bot -p2 oldbot -n 50
```
